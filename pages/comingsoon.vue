      This featuere is coming in the public release. <br />
      You will be able to save a generated command line to "My Stuff" (top right
      corner). <br />
      You will be asked for a name (eg. "minimal postgres", "stimulus with
      postgres and rspec"). <br />
      For now this will store a cookie in your browser, with the name as the key
      and the command line as a value.<br />
      Upside: lightweight - no need to log in, add database support etc.<br />
      Downside: it will only live in the browser you saved from, you can
      loose<br />
      your cookies etc. If it will be a feature people are going to need (IF
      they are going to use the site in the first place :-), I might add support
      for FaunaDB or similar.
