      There‚Äôs no shortage of confused/frustrated/angry tweets, forum messages,
      and WTFs about creating a new Rails app from scratch.

      And that's just what I gathered in a couple of minutes, following a quick
      'rails new' twitter search üòÖ.

      <a href="https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/interactive-rails-new/74355">
        It‚Äôs one of the most popular threads (second, at the time of writing) in
        the 2020‚Äôs ‚ÄúMay of WTFs‚Äù

    <paragraph>
      Even DHH weighed in on the subject:

    <paragraph>
      The same command that used to be every Rails dev‚Äôs favorite has become a
      source of angst and developer fatigue. How did we get here, and more
      importantly, how should we fix it?
    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
      It might seem like a trivial issue (‚Äòjust slap on an extra parameter
      ‚Äî-minimal‚Äô) so why the fuss?

    <paragraph>
      Well, if you start thinking about a generic solution that would benefit
      the community at large (newbies and veterans alike), you‚Äôll soon realize
      that it‚Äôs necessarily going to be surprisingly complex and nuanced:
    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
      1) it‚Äôs difficult to agree even on the most basic terms. ‚Äòsimplistic‚Äô,
      ‚Äòeveryday‚Äô, ‚Äòcirca-2007‚Äô, ‚Äòused for most apps‚Äô means something else for
      everyone.
    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
      2) even once that‚Äôs clarified, there's plenty of implementational
      complexity. Command line flags (which? how many? how should they work?) or
      interactive mode (choosing the bits and pieces that should be generated)
      or something else?
    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
      railsnew.io falls into the ‚Äòsomething else‚Äô category: it‚Äôs a web app to
      <span class="italic">generate the command line</span>. Once it‚Äôs
      generated, you just need to copy'n'paste and run it. No need for further
      customization, extra flags or interactive mode: the generated command line
      captures <span class="italic">everything you want your app to be</span>.
    </paragraph>

    </div>

    <paragraph>
      It might sound backwards to visit a webpage in order to accomplish an
      inherently command line-based task, so here are some benefits to consider:
    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
      1. Avoiding 'buying a latte in a hipster coffee shop' syndrome: sometimes
      you just want a latte, and you don't know/care what to pick
      <span class="italic">exactly</span>: 0.5%/1%/2%/3% milk?
      soy/almond/rice/tapioca/buffalo/yak? bio/organic/vegan/fair trade?
      hazelnut/toffee/organic pine nut/red-velvet-sorbet syrup? half-caff,
      doppio, poured over brewed coffee, dipped, iced, stirred but not shaken?
      JUST GIVE ME MY FUCKING LATTE ALREADY. Please?!<br />
      But the questions just keep coming relentlessly! This is fine if you are a
      coffee aficionado, but if you are ordering your first latte, you might
      want to take your time and understand your options.

      2. Verifying your setup. Follow detailed instructions to feel confident
      that the railsbytes you added (Stimulus, Strimulus Reflex, Tailwind,
      Bootstrap etc.) work by generating a controller and checking the view
      (using the generated stuff). The instructions are tailored to the stack
      you just set up!
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      3. Storing and re-using your favorite `rails new` command lines (COMING
      SOON). Perhaps minimalistic (whatever that means to YOU), stimulus-enabled
      or omakase BUT (postgres, rspec, no emails - you get the idea). Set up
      once, use anytime in the future!
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      4. Describing how each flag works / Linking to documentation / Displaying
      what files would be added or changed (with diffs) etc. (COMING SOON)
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      5. And more -
      <n-link to="about#get-in-touch" class="underline text-indigo-800"
        >get in touch</n-link
      >
      and let us know what else would you find useful!
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      If it sounds interesting, check out the
      <n-link to="live-demo" class="underline text-indigo-800"
        >live demo</n-link
      >
      and give it a spin!
