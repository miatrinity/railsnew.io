      railsnew.io was originally created by us: Mia Sinek and Trinity Takei. Hi
      👋! We are an indie maker couple currently living in sunny Valencia, Spain
      🇪🇸. If you are in the area, drop by for a ☕️ (it's on us)!

      After working for almost two decades on everyone else’s dreams, we are
      ready to pursue our own. railsnew.io is our first baby step, but there’s
      definitely more to come - stay tuned!
